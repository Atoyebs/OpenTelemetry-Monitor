## 1. Query Performance Metrics

### 1.1. Queries Per Second (QPS)
- **Description**: Measures the rate at which queries are being executed.
- **Significance**: High QPS can indicate heavy query load, which can stress the database.

### 1.2. Slow Queries
- **Description**: Counts the number of queries taking longer than the `long_query_time` threshold.
- **Significance**: High slow query count suggests performance issues with specific queries that need optimization.

### 1.3. Query Execution Time
- **Description**: Measures the time taken to execute queries.
- **Significance**: Long execution times indicate slow queries, which can be optimized for better performance.

## 2. Resource Utilization Metrics

### 2.1. CPU Usage
- **Description**: Measures the percentage of CPU resources used by MySQL.
- **Significance**: High CPU usage can indicate intensive query processing or insufficient hardware resources.

### 2.2. Memory Usage
- **Description**: Tracks the memory consumed by MySQL processes.
- **Significance**: High memory usage might indicate the need for optimization or increased memory allocation.

### 2.3. Disk I/O Usage
- **Description**: Measures the read and write operations performed on disk.
- **Significance**: High disk I/O usage can indicate bottlenecks due to slow disk performance or inefficient queries.

## 3. InnoDB Metrics

### 3.1. InnoDB Buffer Pool Usage
- **Metrics**:
  - **`innodb_buffer_pool_size`**: Total size allocated for the InnoDB buffer pool.
  - **`innodb_buffer_pool_reads`**: Number of logical reads from the buffer pool.
  - **`innodb_buffer_pool_pages_free`**: Free pages available in the buffer pool.
- **Significance**: Ensures that the buffer pool is adequately sized and used effectively to cache data.

### 3.2. InnoDB Row Operations
- **Metrics**:
  - **`innodb_rows_read`**: Number of rows read from InnoDB tables.
  - **`innodb_rows_inserted`**: Number of rows inserted into InnoDB tables.
  - **`innodb_rows_updated`**: Number of rows updated in InnoDB tables.
  - **`innodb_rows_deleted`**: Number of rows deleted from InnoDB tables.
- **Significance**: Helps assess the write workload and potential contention issues.

## 4. Table and Index Metrics

### 4.1. Table Scans
- **Metric**: **`Handler_read_rnd_next`**
- **Description**: Counts full table scans performed.
- **Significance**: High values indicate inefficient queries that do not use indexes properly.

### 4.2. Index Usage
- **Metrics**:
  - **`Handler_read_key`**: Number of reads performed using an index.
  - **`Handler_read_next`**: Number of sequential reads from an index.
- **Significance**: High values suggest effective use of indexes, which is crucial for query performance.

## 5. Lock and Concurrency Metrics

### 5.1. Table Locks
- **Metric**: **`Table_locks_waited`**
- **Description**: Counts the number of times table locks caused a wait.
- **Significance**: High values can indicate contention and locking issues.

### 5.2. InnoDB Row Lock Time
- **Metric**: **`Innodb_row_lock_time`**
- **Description**: Total time spent in acquiring row locks.
- **Significance**: High values indicate contention and potential deadlock issues.

## 6. Connection Metrics

### 6.1. Threads Connected
- **Metric**: **`Threads_connected`**
- **Description**: Number of currently open connections to MySQL.
- **Significance**: Helps gauge the load and potential connection handling issues.

### 6.2. Threads Running
- **Metric**: **`Threads_running`**
- **Description**: Number of threads actively processing queries.
- **Significance**: High values may indicate a high load or slow query processing.

## 7. I/O Performance Metrics

### 7.1. Disk Throughput
- **Metrics**:
  - **Read Throughput**: Rate of data read from disk.
  - **Write Throughput**: Rate of data written to disk.
- **Significance**: Indicates how well the disk subsystem is handling I/O operations.

### 7.2. I/O Wait Time
- **Metric**: **`mysql.table.io.wait.time`**
- **Description**: Cumulative time spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.
- **Significance**: High values indicate I/O bottlenecks impacting database performance.

## 8. Cache and Buffer Metrics

### 8.1. Query Cache Hit Ratio
- **Metric**: **`Qcache_hits` / (`Qcache_hits` + `Qcache_inserts` + `Qcache_not_cached`)**
- **Description**: Percentage of queries served from the query cache.
- **Significance**: Higher ratios indicate effective use of the query cache.

### 8.2. Key Buffer Usage
- **Metric**: **`Key_blocks_used / Key_blocks_unused`**
- **Description**: Measures the usage of the key buffer for MyISAM tables.
- **Significance**: Indicates how well the key buffer is utilized.

## 9. Replication Metrics

### 9.1. Replication Lag
- **Metric**: **`Seconds_Behind_Master`**
- **Description**: Measures the delay in applying changes from the master to the replica.
- **Significance**: High values can indicate replication performance issues or network latency.

### 9.2. Slave SQL Running
- **Metric**: **`Slave_SQL_Running`**
- **Description**: Indicates whether the SQL thread for replication is running.
- **Significance**: If not running, replication issues may be present.

## Monitoring Tools and Best Practices

- **Tools**: Use monitoring tools such as Grafana, Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), MySQL Enterprise Monitor, or cloud-native solutions like AWS CloudWatch for continuous monitoring.
- **Baseline and Alerts**: Establish baselines for each metric and set up alerts for significant deviations to proactively address potential issues.
- **Regular Audits**: Perform regular performance audits and tuning based on metrics to maintain optimal performance.
